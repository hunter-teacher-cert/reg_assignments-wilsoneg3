# Unit 2 Project

## List of files
- Unit 2 project: The pdf of the assignment to give students
- Edid 2021 C1 Data: The edited data for students to use to complete the project

## Rationale
- This assignment has been created using actual attendance data from our school because it is a way to build a bridge between real-world data and our real world.  We are attempting to help students discover the importance and applicability of Statistics using their immediate context in part as a way to motivate them towards increased academic success while simultaneously teaching them content knowledge (sneaky sneaky!).  The students will enter the curated data into the various tables for practice before conducting calculations they have developed over the unit.  They then add their own attendance data into the project in order to calculate their own credit residual.

## Solutions
I did not create a solution for this project because all students will be getting different results and I don't want to confuse them.
