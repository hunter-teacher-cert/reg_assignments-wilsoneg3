# Unit 2 Project

## List of files
- Unit 2 project: The pdf of the assignment to give students
- Edid 2021 C1 Data: The edited data for students to use to complete the project

## Rationale
- This assignment has been created using actual attendance data from our school because it is a way to build a bridge between real-world data and our real world.  We are attempting to help students discover the importance and applicability of Statistics using their immediate context in part as a way to motivate them towards increased academic success while simultaneously 

## Solutions
I did not create a solution for this project because all students will be getting different results and I don't want to confuse them.

Create an in-class assignment for using real world data.
Create a potential full-credit submission for your assignment.
To submit, create a folder in your classwork repository called 02_data
Put all the files for your submission here.
Include any solution files (these may vary depending on the assignment).
Put the assignment instructions in a file called README.md
At the top, include a list of other files in this directory along with a description
You will be presenting this assignment to a small group next class.
