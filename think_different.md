  * Describe 3 diffferent strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.

Differentiating for learning levels:
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
 The biggest need that I try to differentiate for is learning levels.  My students came back from the pandemic with varying levels of mastery of basic algebra skills and navigating the coordinate plane.  This led to lots of offline assignments.
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
 I generally try to place students in heterogeneous groups.  Occasinally if students miss a day or two of school I will group them at a table to catch them up on work while the rest of the class continues.  Heterogeneous grouping is helpful because students can help each other out more.
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
The goal of heterogeneous grouping is to help students close skill gaps while creating a collaborative environment and viewing each other as resources.
  
  Differentiating for learning styles:
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
When I differentiate for learning styles I like to be sure to incoprorate multiple ways of dispensing the same info.  I like using offline, listening, and visual activities. 
- Are students being grouped? If so, how?
Students do not need to be deliberately grouped.
- What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
Provide multiple entry points for learning and meeting students where they are at.

  Differentiating for homework:
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
Differentiating for interest by providing mild, medium, and spicy assignments.
- Are students being grouped? If so, how?
Students do not need to be deliberately grouped.
- What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?
Help students practice making choices and self-select based on their skills and interest level.
