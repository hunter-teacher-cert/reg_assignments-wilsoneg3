## * Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.

In the beforetimes, I was trying to teach the arc function using p5.js.  I was teaching a large class of students with almost zero prior experience with computer science.  Approximately 50% of the class had IEPs.  I was teaching using slides, peblio, and p5.js editor.  I thought that direct instruction combined with the reference page and my well-designed student worksheet on peblio would be enough to help students wade their way through the material.  It was not.  The peblio stopped working for about half the class and they were confused how to interface between all of my different pieces of technology which were intended to be helpful but ended up being more disruptive.  The lesson completely broke down and I would be shocked if anybody learned about the arc function that day. 


 ## - Why do you think it didn't go well?
  
  Any teacher that has been in the profession for more than 1 day has had a lesson go poorly, so you come to accept that sometimes the products you design are not going to be useful 100% of the time.  I think it didn't go well because I didn't assess my students' prior knowledge of coordinate planes beforehand properly.  I also was using too many pieces of technology to illustrate a concept that can be challenging to understand theoretically.
  
##  - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
 I have since designed an entirely offline way of teaching the arc function towards helping them craft their yin yang projects.  This helps them concretize the project, write out the code first, and then bring it to the computer.
 
 
## * Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.
I designed a project encouraging students to design their own clothing/ outfit/ or shoe to generate interest in differentiating between HSB and RGB color modes.  The kids always get really into it.
  - Why do you think it went so well?
Excitement is sometimes the number one key to building student interest and helping them become self motivated learners.
