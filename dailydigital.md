The article details how a new study provided a more comprehensive, detailed, and overall substantial analysis of the negative effects of social media on the developing brain.  According to the text, heavy use of social media spurred lower ratings of “life satisfaction”: first around puberty — ages 11 to 13 for girls, and 14 to 15 for boys — and then again for both sexes around age 19.”  According to the report, it found that heavy social media use predicted lower life-satisfaction ratings a year after the study began.  The results are in line with the widely conceived notion that girls go through more significant social development at an earlier stage than boys do.  What united the genders was the age of 19, when young people hit a second period of social media sensitivity.  Some possible reasons for the second period are starting college, a new job, or living independently for the first time.  Another detail is that for all ages, participants who felt bad about their lives wound up spending more time on social media a year later. This suggests that for some people the technology may be a coping mechanism for sadness as opposed to the central cause of negative feelings.

“It carries risks — peer influence, contagion, substance use,” Dr. Jensen said. “But it can also carry lots of positive things,” like support, connection, creativity and skill mastery, she added. “I think a lot of times that does get overlooked because we’re so focused on risks.”
