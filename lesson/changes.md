Functions are something I sometimes still struggle with as a learner myself, so when my group decided to teach functions I was a little nervous.

I started trying to re-learn some of the things we went over in the summertime and began trying to shoehorn myself into learning more Python so I could contribute on a more significant level.  This didn't go so well, so I was very grateful to Mamudu who suggested I try to do functions in Scratch.

After doing some research I was able to throw together my first attempt.  It went okay, but everyone helped me narrow the focus of my lesson and build in more direct instruction to help students understand the concepts more.
